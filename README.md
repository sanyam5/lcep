# Low-cost engineering preparation
# This is still incomplete!! Contributers are trying to complete it. Please come back after some time. Thank you. 
A village boy's guide to engineering entrance preparation.

Here is a list of resources in very simple english that can help students who:
- Can understand simple English.
- Want to prepare for getting into great engineering colleges like IIT, IIIT, NIT, BITS.
- Don't have the financial resources to join coaching.
- Don't have broadband and computer access.

If you have the financial resources to join a coaching, then I **highly** recommend doing that.

If you have broadband and computer access then there are many resources you can use such as http://khanacademy.org

The aim of writing this guide is to help students prepare for engineering entrance exams in less than 50 thousand rupees.

Let's start !!

## How to use this guide?

Books are your best friends. Many school teachers are not knowledgeable. They teach wrong concepts to bright students. Students get confused and join coaching. But everyone cannot join coaching. So what should they do? Don't worry. If you know the right books then you can still prepare for engineering and get into good colleges.

I am a student at IIT Kharagpur. I am going to guide you about what books are good. I will also tell you how to make a study plan based on which class you are in. You do not need to read all the chapters in this guide. Just choose the chapters according to which class you are in and follow the instructions.

## Distance Learning Programs(for all classes)
Beside doing self study on your own you can also subscribe to Distance Learning programs offered by various institutes.
###Distance Learning Programs:
- Coaching institutes provide Distance Learning Programs to students all over India for a very low cost around just 10 thousand rupees per year. They provide books, question papers with answer keys.
- You can visit the websites of FIITJEE, Bansal Classes(Kota), Aakash IIT-JEE, IITians Pace, VMC Coaching to get more information.


## If you are in class 11th.
You are in class 11th right now or you have just finished class 10th. This is the perfect time to start preparing for JEE. So you should start increasing your level of knowledge step by step.
